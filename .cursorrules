# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section so you will not make the same mistake again.

Use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. When receiving a new task, review the content, clear old tasks if necessary, explain the current task, and plan steps to complete it. Use todo markers to indicate progress:
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Update progress in the Scratchpad when finishing subtasks or milestones to maintain a big picture of the task.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons
- Use python venv in ./venv for development. Check for 'uv' with `which uv`. If available, use `uv pip install`; otherwise, use `pip`.
- For git multiline commit messages, write to a file and use `git commit -F <filename>`. Include "[Cursor] " in commit messages and PR titles.
- The official BTS brand color is #FFDE00 (yellow) and should be used for branded elements instead of purple.
- When customizing Sonner library toast notifications, use standard properties in ExternalToast type and avoid non-standard properties like 'descriptionStyle'.
- For Next.js page layouts, set specific max-width constraints instead of relying on container classes to maintain consistent widths across different screen sizes.
- For image creation in canvas contexts, use `document.createElement('img')` instead of `new Image()` to avoid TypeScript errors.
- Use Unicode escape sequences like `\u201C` (left double quote) and `\u201D` (right double quote) for special characters in TypeScript/JavaScript to avoid syntax and linter errors.
- When deploying to hosting platforms like Netlify or Vercel, ensure that all necessary environment variables (such as Supabase credentials) are configured in the platform's environment settings.
- For mobile-friendly spacing in Next.js layouts, use responsive padding classes (e.g., pt-0 md:pt-8) to reduce space between navbar and content on small screens while maintaining appropriate spacing on larger displays.
- Avoid using console.error in production code; instead, use conditional logging based on NODE_ENV to show detailed errors only in development.
- When implementing SEO in Next.js, metadata cannot be exported from client components (with "use client" directive). For client pages, create a separate metadata.ts file in the same directory.
- For date and time displays that need to work across different user timezones, implement client-side timezone handling using the browser's Date API instead of server-side fixed timezones.
- When working with third-party APIs like Spotify that have rate limits, implement these strategies to prevent 429 errors: 1) Add local caching, 2) Use exponential backoff for retries, 3) Process batch requests sequentially with delays, 4) Add client-side throttling, and 5) Provide clear user feedback during retries.
- When Supabase operations fail with empty error objects `{}`, it usually means the database tables don't exist yet. Always provide helpful error messages that mention "Database tables may not exist. Please run the SQL schema first." instead of just logging the empty error object.
- When implementing like/love counters in Supabase, ensure the main table's like_count field is properly updated when likes are added/removed from the likes junction table. Don't just read the existing like_count - calculate the actual count from the likes table and update the main table to keep it synchronized.
- For generating visual album covers from text data, use deterministic color palette selection based on song title character codes to ensure consistent colors across sessions while providing variety between different playlists.
- **BTS Playlist Love Button Fix**: When implementing playlist like functionality, always include proper error handling for empty error objects, duplicate like prevention, and manual like count synchronization as a fallback to triggers. Use try-catch blocks with specific error type checking and provide helpful user feedback.

## Cursor learned
- Handle UTF-8 encoding properly for international search queries
- Use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' due to recent version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- In Next.js, `dynamic` imports with `{ ssr: false }` cannot be used directly in Server Components. Create a client component wrapper with "use client" that handles the dynamic import.
- For React 19 compatibility issues with packages like react-day-picker, use --legacy-peer-deps or downgrade to React 18.2.0
- When renaming React component functions, maintain backward compatibility with additional named exports
- In Next.js sitemap.ts files, use 'as const' type assertion for changeFrequency values to match the expected literal types in MetadataRoute.Sitemap
- In Next.js projects with aliased imports (@/hooks, @/components), make sure to maintain proper directory structures and use re-export files to maintain backward compatibility when refactoring.
