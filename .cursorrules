# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section so you will not make the same mistake again.

Use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. When receiving a new task, review the content, clear old tasks if necessary, explain the current task, and plan steps to complete it. Use todo markers to indicate progress:
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Update progress in the Scratchpad when finishing subtasks or milestones to maintain a big picture of the task.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons
- Use python venv in ./venv for development. Check for 'uv' with `which uv`. If available, use `uv pip install`; otherwise, use `pip`.
- For git multiline commit messages, write to a file and use `git commit -F <filename>`. Include "[Cursor] " in commit messages and PR titles.
- The official BTS brand color is #FFDE00 (yellow) and should be used for branded elements instead of purple.
- When customizing Sonner library toast notifications, use standard properties in ExternalToast type and avoid non-standard properties like 'descriptionStyle'.
- For Next.js page layouts, set specific max-width constraints instead of relying on container classes to maintain consistent widths across different screen sizes.
- For image creation in canvas contexts, use `document.createElement('img')` instead of `new Image()` to avoid TypeScript errors.
- Use Unicode escape sequences like `\u201C` (left double quote) and `\u201D` (right double quote) for special characters in TypeScript/JavaScript to avoid syntax and linter errors.

## Cursor learned
- Handle UTF-8 encoding properly for international search queries
- Use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' due to recent version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- In Next.js, `dynamic` imports with `{ ssr: false }` cannot be used directly in Server Components. Create a client component wrapper with "use client" that handles the dynamic import.
- For React 19 compatibility issues with packages like react-day-picker, use --legacy-peer-deps or downgrade to React 18.2.0
- When renaming React component functions, maintain backward compatibility with additional named exports

## Message Box UI Pattern
- Container: White background, black border (2px), rounded corners (16px)
- Heading: "Black Han Sans" font, ~32px, black, center-aligned
- Form Layout: Vertical stack with ~16-20px spacing
- Input Fields: Black border (2px), white background, rounded corners (8px), padding (12px)
- Submit Button: Black background, yellow text (#FFDE00), purple heart emoji, full width, rounded (8px)
- Labels: Bold, black text, slightly larger than input text
- Textarea: Taller than regular inputs, same styling pattern
